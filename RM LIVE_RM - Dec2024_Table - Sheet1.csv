"Wow! The restaurant was excellent! Everything was amazing! The food was tasty.
We had the chicken souvlaki platter and the Greek salad. Everything was so fresh and delicious. The rice and the potatoes were so flavourful. Usually I find when I’ve been to Greek restaurants the rice is so bland not here! The chicken souvlaki was so juicy and delicious! Greek salad was fresh and plentiful! Last but not least the tzatziki sauce was tasty too. Our server was very friendly! The atmosphere was spot on! It was well  worth it! A hidden gem!","We're happy to hear about your wonderful experience!

"Best Bagels I have ever tasted!!  A true New York-style bagel experience I was looking forward to in my visit to New York!                            Exceptional quality of the bagels with wide variety of cream cheese options and bagel options as well as generous portions!
I have tried several different bagels but the two I loved the most were the sesame bagel and the turkey bacon & cheddar cragel! The sesame bagel was crunchy on the outside with delicious taste of freshly roasted sesame and heavenly soft, and  fluffy in the inside. The turkey bacon and cheddar cragel was sooo delicious I kept eating even when I was full! I LOVE the texture AND taste. It is light, crunchy and soft all at the same time and has croissant taste to it but savory because of the cheddar cheese and the turkey bacon. Surly my new FAVORITE!
Also, if you stop by Bagel Point, you can’t leave without trying their home made Bagel Chips (crunchy and flavorful! Great with hummus or avocado dip) Furthermore, don’t forget their freshly in house made juices!! Especially the immune boost one! You can literally taste the freshness of each of the ingredients: the apples, carrots, oranges, kale and ginger!

Love their cheese texture! It’s whipped and fluffy yet VERY creamy!  They have great selection of both sweet and savory flavors! Lots of herbs and veggie options as well as fruits.

All in all, wide selection and variety of cream cheese options and  bagel flavors. They have everything from vegetarian options to meat lovers variety! From sweet to savory; Bagel Point has it all!! I would eat there every day without getting bored of it! 100% would recommend this place! great atmosphere, wonderful service, and overall amazing experience! I can’t wait to come back to NY just to eat here AGAIN! Bagel Point, please consider coming to MICHIGAN or start shipping !!!

"It's all about the kids and they did have a good time but for what was spent, 2 hours wasn't enough time. Eating, opening presents and eating cake really only left maybe an hour for the kids to play. Then we had to buy cards to use for the arcade games, and tax was added to the card purchases so if you planned on getting a $20 card it cost $21.20 and the machine didn't give change. My wife and I purchased $50 in cards +tax. Am I wrong that you put a quarter or 2 in a machine and no tax is collected?¿ What happened to that. Then with all the ""tickets"" they collected they could only get candy. Like I said, the birthday boy and 2 of the cousins had a good time but the smallest of the bunch only had a small play area upstairs away from the other kids.  I'm sure we may go back and let the kids play but I don't see renting out a party room being part of that plan.","Thank you for your comprehensive feedback, Mark.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Cliff Dining in Draper and wanted to share my experience. The restaurant offers two distinct seating areas: one side opens up to the bar, which can be lively and a bit loud, while the other side is much quieter and cozier. If you’re looking for a more peaceful ambiance, you can let the host know your preference upon arrival.

A standout part of the evening was the exceptional service. If you visit, I highly recommend asking for Sophie as your server. She truly goes above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need. Her attentiveness and warm personality made the experience even better.

Now, let’s talk about the food. The spinach dip appetizer is absolutely phenomenal—a must-try! The rest of the food was very good overall, though I was a bit disappointed with the jambalaya. It didn’t quite hit the mark as a true Southern-style dish, which was a little misleading.

Despite that, the overall experience was pleasant.

"The wait is usually quite long for dinner. Suggest to line up virtually using Yelp Waitlist before going to the restaurant during dinner time - this might save you of waiting outside 30+ mins.

Service was slow when we went there for dinner. After bringing out the dishes, they “forgot” us until we asked for the bill. We wished the service was better.

Food reviews:
1.  Roti Canai - Meh. Don’t think it was made in house. Curry dip is okay. You can skip this appetizer.

2. Curry Puff - Meh. Made in house but small. You will be eating mostly crust and not much filling. The filling was just potatoes. You can skip this appetizer.

3. Char Kway Teow - 9.5/10 Yummy. This dish is authentic and the best dish tonight. Noodles charred slightly to give it the perfect taste and texture. Ingredients were eggs, shrimp,  tender chicken pieces, and perfect amount of soy bean sprouts. Would have been better with slightly more noodles.

4. Ampang Yong Tofu - 8/10 Good. We chose the mild curry version. It came with generous amounts of tofu stuffed with fish paste. Also inside the curry were okra, bell peppers, onions and chili. You might opt for clear broth if you don’t want the heavier coconut curry sauce.

We didn’t get the chance to try the desert, but they have the typical Malaysian Chendol, Ice Kacang, and Fried Banana.

Great experience. We had the combo #3. Good portions for the meat. Sides portions were a bit small. We got the half rack of ribs which was the best of the 3. We got the brisket and the pulled pork which were good as well. I like that they don’t drench the meat in sauce. For the sides we got the potato salad and the fried okra. I also got the chili. The chili was jam packed with beans and meat and very hearty. It could be a meal on its own. Highly recommend the chili.,"We're glad to know that you enjoyed our service, and your review of our hearty chili brightened our day.

"I was very satisfied with my experience at this Pizza Inn.  Food was fresh, hot, and fast (and I saw service staff quality checking items that had been out for longer with frequency, and taking away unfinished items that I assume they felt were no longer fresh enough to serve to customers), as well as very good.  This Pizza Inn fully lived up to my expectations of this type of restaurant.  I only did the salad bar and pizza, so cannot speak to the pasta station.  For us and from a value perspective, we are never going to be able to eat enough for the buffet to be worth it from a quantity perspective, however; we find the value comes in being able to have such a large variety of items all in one meal.  As such, the price (I think around $15 for an adult) is well worth it.

The service staff were extremely nice and welcoming, especially the gentleman in the wheelchair who spoke to us while we were waiting for a seat.  My sole complaint, and seriously, this barely mattered to us, was that there was some pizza pieces on the floor next to us.  However, I feel like this was more due to the numerous young children at the table next to us rather than inattentiveness by the wait staff.  We dined on Saturday; it was busy.  These things happen.  If the trade off was one less person quality checking the food so that there was an additional on floor cleaning duty, I truly would not have taken that trade off.

Pizza buffets are unfortunately seemingly disappearing.  While I appreciate very much upscale pizza places and other types of restaurants, a pizza bar restaurant is a unique and, to me, nostalgic experience.  If you feel the same, this location should be on your list.","Becks, we're thrilled our fresh food and attentive staff met your expectations.

We eagerly await your next visit!","Here is the <Google> Review <I was very satisfied with my experience at this Pizza Inn.  Food was fresh, hot, and fast (and I saw service staff quality checking items that had been out for longer with frequency, and taking away unfinished items that I assume they felt were no longer fresh enough to serve to customers), as well as very good.  This Pizza Inn fully lived up to my expectations of this type of restaurant.  I only did the salad bar and pizza, so cannot speak to the pasta station.  For us and from a value perspective, we are never going to be able to eat enough for the buffet to be worth it from a quantity perspective, however; we find the value comes in being able to have such a large variety of items all in one meal.  As such, the price (I think around $15 for an adult) is well worth it.

The service staff were extremely nice and welcoming, especially the gentleman in the wheelchair who spoke to us while we were waiting for a seat.  My sole complaint, and seriously, this barely mattered to us, was that there was some pizza pieces on the floor next to us.  However, I feel like this was more due to the numerous young children at the table next to us rather than inattentiveness by the wait staff.  We dined on Saturday; it was busy.  These things happen.  If the trade off was one less person quality checking the food so that there was an additional on floor cleaning duty, I truly would not have taken that trade off.

Pizza buffets are unfortunately seemingly disappearing.  While I appreciate very much upscale pizza places and other types of restaurants, a pizza bar restaurant is a unique and, to me, nostalgic experience.

"If I can give 0 zero I would for CustomerCare

Received incorrect to go order, I ordered vegetable biriyani but received Egg and Chicken Biriyani. 
I called them and explained I have allergy and this incorrect order made me go back to another restaurant to buy food again. 
They asked us to email and promised response in 1-2 days. It's been one week and no response from the team. 
It's very disappointing that they cannot respond to email or get back to customer to solve the issue.
I also called back multiple times to follow up but they gave the same response - to email and wait... 

This is a phone pick up order and I can clearly see that they don't care about these customers whereas Uber or DoorDash customers could have handled it better through them. 

All I can suggest is for folks to open and confirm your order before pickup because as customer you will never get a response for your issue from this restaurant.

"I was in the market to get the best bang for my buck. Frank helped me find what options would get the job done for my destinations and uses. I'm happy I shopped around and found the right travel trailer for me at RV Land. My No Boundries 19.3 has everything I wanted and a little more for a good price. Josh, the technician that went over the camper with me, made sure that everything was as it should be. The process took a few hours but he was very patient and answered all of my questions. I have a list of notes I took from the experience I will put to work.

"Great neighborhood location with friendly service.  The bar is great to sit around and have a couple cocktails. 

Chicken Parmesan was forgettable and was served on a bed of pasta with so much pasta water that the chicken got soggy and salty. Marinara sauce still lacked flavor and depth. 

Carbonara sauce was gloppy and the oil separated from the sauce. 

Grilled salmon was well cooked.  Calamari was delicious and tasted fresh. Ceasar salad was good. 

Burger and fries were good and the fries weee enjoyed by everyone. Chicken fingers were also good.

"I was craving popcorn chicken and some tea, I'll usually go into 626 just for it but this is closer so decided to try it out since everyone was saying it was the best popcorn chicken in the valley. I got a peach mango tea with 25% sugar and popcorn chicken. The tea tasted like straight up water. I get that i only got 25% sugar but usually when i get this at other places the fruit makes up for the missed sweetness. This had 0.02% flavor and the rest literally tasted like just water. The popcorn chicken wasn't like what im used to. The flavor was ok, the chicken was crispy but just wasn't what i was looking for. This has a lot of great reviews which is why i wanted to check it out but i think it's ok for the location but if i want real tea and popcorn chicken I'll just drive into the 626.","We apologize that your experience with us fell short of expectations, Leslie.

"I was invited here today for a birthday brunch. Never have been here before. We arrived for Sunday brunch. Be advised you cannot order from the menu during Sunday brunch. 

However, the options are great. They have fresh omelets made to order, tacos with hand made tortillas in front of you. They have pozole, menudo, American breakfast items as well as Mexican options such as shrimp, birria, lengua, rice, and beans. Add mariachi to that mix and this spot is the one you want to be at!

The food was great but what made MY experience above average was REME! She is attentive, very helpful, came around often to check on us. She provides amazing customer service! I highly recommend the restaurant but you MUST ask for Reme to have the experience I had. Thank you Reme loving your job and the customers you serve!!

"Could not be more disappointed. To start it off everyone not cutting hair was sitting slouched in their barber seats on their phone with almost no greeting. To start - JOEL did not sweep up any of the hair from the gentlemen whose hair he cut and beard he shaved from the appointment before my sons. He then continued to use the SAME apron to cover my son that he just used prior on a client who had his beard trimmed. But I need to say, though the haircut itself was not bad, my requests  were not met in the slightest bit. I told JOEL I did not want any of my son's length cut (he's almost 4 and  has had his long curls since about 1). I asked for him to shape up the sides and only trims the bangs for a subtle mullet. If Joel wasn't too busy trying to make small talk with me (while I was also on the phone with my manager) he would have been able to pay a little more attention. I also DID stop him during it and said you're not cutting the back right and he replied with no.  I'm not so much disappointed with the haircut, I'm sure someone would have loved it that asked for it, but certainly disappointed with the lack of care and attention to details. I did ask how much I owed him, he said nothing, so I left a $20 tip for the time spent. What is truly the dirtiest part of this for me, which is why I am writing a review, which I have not on any platform since 2017 is because......

"Unfortunately, our experience at this restaurant was disappointing. We were initially seated at a very poor spot—a window table partially blocked by the back of a TV screen—even though the restaurant was nearly empty. Upon our request, a friendly waitress did move us to a better table, which we appreciated.

However, the disappointment continued when we ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice. It was clearly not fresh and tasted artificial, likely made from concentrate or a carton.

We were initially seated at a very poor spot—a window table partially blocked by the back of a TV screen—even though the restaurant was nearly empty. Upon our request, a friendly waitress did move us to a better table, which we appreciated.

However, the disappointment continued when we ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice. It was clearly not fresh and tasted artificial, likely made from concentrate or a carton.

"We were in the Freehold area and figured we would knock another well known pizza place off the list.  We went around 4 on a Sunday.  It wasn't busy when we got there since it was sort of an off time, but definitely more packed when we left.  There is parking behind the building and free parking on Sunday evenings (maybe other times too, but we noticed for the time we were there).  Walking in the back there is an area for pickup of takeout orders.  If you walk straight ahead down the narrow hallway is up to the hostess station.  We were seated right away.  The restaurant is very long with different rooms.  We were taking all the way to the back where the bar was.  It definitely feels like you are stepping back in time in this restaurant.  The menu is somewhat limited, which sometimes I prefer.  We knew we were going to get pizza but was unsure of which kind.  We grabbed a couple waters and some sodas and perused the menu a bit.  I was thinking based on seeing other patrons pizzas, it would be similar to Vic's in Bradley Beach.  We realized we are not HUGE fans of thin crust pizza but was still willing to try.  We decided on the Vodka Sauce pizza.  It came out pretty fast.  It was HOT so we let it cool a bit.  It was definitely thin crust.  Crispy but not overly crispy.  We are very happy we got it was the vodka sauce as it gave it a little dimension.  It was good.  Crispy, gooey enough cheese, and the right amount of sauce.

"I visited for a double cheeseburger, breakfast burrito, chili cheese fries, and a soda, but the experience was disappointing. The staff member taking my order was pushy, rude, and unprofessional.

I noticed that customers who ordered after me were served their food before me on four separate occasions. When I asked for ranch, I was told it costs $0.75, yet I saw her giving it to other customers for free.

Since I didn't get ranch, I decided not to eat my chili cheese fries and asked for a refund. Instead of resolving the situation politely, she snatched the fries from my tray, handed them to another customer for free, and refunded me.

"From the initial contact to the final clean up, Vegas Born Roofing was a joy to work with.  Tommy helped us pick out the perfect tile and everything he said was going to happen and the timeline could not have been more spot on.  Efram and the install crew worked their butts off each day and completed the project on time with very little disruption to the household.  They were considerate of the neighbors and waited for traffic without blocking the road.  Izzy was always just a phone call or text away and responded immediately with anything we needed.  I would recommend Vegas Born Roofing to anyone that needs to get their project done right and on time.  Thanks everyone, job well done.","We're glad to know about your positive experience with us, Johnny!

My low rating is simply because of the food. Ordered the well advertised Chole Bhatura and the popular Paneer tikka wrap. Both super average in taste. It's like there was zero salt and spice. The Chole was undergarnished with onions. Best part - the pickle and onions were extra charge! The panner tikka masala was watery and creamy. Definitely not going here again.

"Wow! Called about installing a brand new Groehe kitchen faucet. This is a fairly new kitchen so it should just pop in there.  It's about a one hour to maybe ninety minute job. Was quoted $609 for labor!

The guy who came out was polite and showed up in the quoted window but that's insane! Now I am OK with paying the industry standard rate for a  plumber but that's really a bit much. 

If you extrapolate that rate over a year it would look like this - let's assume they figured the job would take ninety minutes or even two hours. That calculates out to $300 hour x 2080 hours in a year = $624,000 a year. Now I realize there's overhead and benefits that has to be  factored in but seems like you could make ends meet and run a profitable business at a much more reasonable hourly rate.

"It's sad to say but Huber's has lost its mojo. In the 90s, Hubers had class, had style, had that certain je ne sais quoi. I took my parents there for Thanksgiving dinner when it wasn't even Thanksgiving.  The server would mesmerize us, making Spanish Coffees table-side with dramatic flare.  But that was yesteryear.  

On a recent visit I was on my own, so I sat at the bar.  The place was almost empty with maybe three tables and a group of three at the other end of the bar.  After several minutes ticked by with no bartender, the host came over and brought me a glass of water.  Then I sat there with my water for several more minutes before the bartender finally resurfaced and absently poured me a glass of water, not noticing that I already had one until she almost put her glass on top of mine.  The rest of the evening didn't go much better.  She seemed more intent on replenishing her coffee tray and putting away the clean glassware from the dishwasher than checking on me.  When I finished my salad, my empty plate sat on the bar for a good long while.  I ordered a salad because I was looking forward to a slice of pumpkin pie.  At least the pie is still good.","We sincerely apologize for your recent experience, Dana. We regret not meeting the standards you fondly remember from past visits.

"I usually don't write negative reviews, but my recent experience at Arya Steakhouse was so frustrating, I felt compelled to share. The food was decent, but the billing practices here are downright infuriating.

First off, they added a mandatory 20% tip to the bill, which I understand at some places, but what really got me was that they charged extra tax on the tip itself. This is not only unreasonable, but it feels like a total rip-off. It's the kind of thing that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, even if the meal itself was fine.

As if that wasn't enough, there was also a 4% ""living wage"" surcharge added on top. They didn't really explain this in advance, so it came as an unpleasant surprise when the check arrived. Between the tip, the extra tax on the tip, and the surcharge, it felt like they were padding the bill at every turn. 

For a place that's supposed to offer a nice dining experience, this feels like a cash grab. I get that tipping culture is a thing, but these hidden fees are just too much. I won't be coming back, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who values transparency in pricing.","We sincerely apologize for your experience, Shaion. We recognize that our billing practices may have seemed confusing. Our mandatory 20% tip ensures fair compensation for our staff, and we regret any miscommunication regarding this. Similarly, our ""living wage"" surcharge is designed to support our team but we agree it should have been more clearly communicated. We deeply value your feedback and will work towards enhancing transparency in our billing practices. We hope you'll give us another opportunity to offer a more satisfactory dining experience.","We sincerely apologize for your experience, Shaion.

"2nd time to go here for mini family reunion, this time for lunch. Again, cheese bread excellent but service was spotty, ambiance was nice. The meal I ordered had to be sent back. The filet mignon was super under cooked and the sides cold. The replacement filet was way smaller then the 1st one but cooked correctly and sides hot. Same plate came back, nuked the veggies and plopped the much smaller filet on plate. The rest of our party ordered hamburgers and salads. The clam chowder was very good.
After having a dinner and lunch here, not going back. I can have a mediocre meal like this was closer to my home.","Sandra, we sincerely apologize that your recent visit fell short of expectations.

"I am sharing this mainly for any potential black patrons.  We experienced blatant racism when attempting to dine there on Saturday December 7, 2024.  An elderly friend of the family we were eating with arrived at the restaurant first.  He attempted to request a table in the main dining room for our party. He was told that there was no availability in the main dining room and there wouldn't be any that evening. He was told that he could have a table at a high top. The high top tables are not conducive for older guests and tend to be uncomfortable. When I arrive he tells me and the rest of our party what they told him.  I proceed to go on Open Table to verify that what he was told was actually true.  If you know how Open Table works, they have access to the resraurants table management system. It is how they update information in real time.  Open table shows that the restaurant has multiple openings for seating for four in the main dining room over the next hour.  Open table gives you the choice between the main dining room and their high tops.  When I show the hostess Gaby this, she tried to tell me that the information in Open Table is wrong and they really don't have any seating.

"I can't recommend St. Louis County Dental Partnership highly enough! From the moment you walk in, the warm and welcoming staff make you feel completely at ease. The office is spotless, modern, and equipped with the latest technology, which ensures a seamless and comfortable experience.

Dr. Bruch is not only incredibly skilled and thorough but also takes the time to explain every step of the process. She also incredible with lip fillers. She also does an amazing job. Recently i took my two year old to the office to get her first check up and i can’t explain how warm the stuff was with her and the toys that she got afterwards.

"I can 100% say this place is terrible. I got one slice of mushroom pizza, and it was almost $5. I mean, I’m okay with that if the slice tastes good, but I don’t even know what I ate. The taste of the slice was cheap. I asked if she could put mayo on the slice, and she said yes. When she brought the slice to me, I asked for mayo again, and she said it would cost $1 extra. She could have mentioned that at the beginning of my order, not when serving my table. I don’t recommend this place. There must be better options nearby.","We're truly sorry for your experience, Mert. It's disappointing to know that we didn't live up to our standard with our pizzas this time.

"We've dined at Bastille many times and have had wonderful experiences there. This time, Bastille missed the mark. Bastille is not inexpensive and when we choose to go there, there is an expectation for good food and good service. I'll start with the service, our server took our order very professionally, and then things went down hill. I ordered the Entrecote, and received a beef filet, I decided to stay with the fillet as all three others in my party had received their food. The beef fillet was not very good and tough. I had to ask for a steak knife as she brought me a butter knife in a very celebratory fashion and presentation, I was quite surprised by that as she knew I needed an additional knife, but did not bring a steak knife.  Dinner continued and the atmosphere was lovely as it always is. For desert I requested a cheese tray. When it arrived, it was simply placed on our table with no explanation of what the cheeses were. The region, goat vs cow milk, and other details are what is fairly standard when serving cheese trays. This was at the end of our meal and we had no silverware on the table as it had been cleared by the busing staff. I had to get my server's attention to have a knife brought to the table and then asked her about the cheeses. To my horror, she did not know what they were and  left to find out what they were serving. This is unacceptable for a restaurant where we spend $250.00 for two of us. There were other miscues, which some can be expected from time to time, but I'll stop there. This restaurant can, and has done better. We may or may not give them another shot as there several French restaurants in walking distance of our home in Old Town.","Hassan, we're truly sorry for your recent dining experience. We recognize the significance of having a satisfying meal, especially at a familiar venue. It's disappointing to learn about your entree mix-up and our insufficient cheese tray knowledge. Such incidents aren't reflective of our standards and we'll address them within our team. We value your feedback because it aids our improvement. We hope you'll give us another opportunity to deliver the high-quality service you're accustomed to.","Hassan, we're truly sorry for your recent dining experience.

"TLDR; food is decent, banchan with little fish is good, service is ok but they are clearly understaffed; bathroom is really sticky and gross

This is a homey tofu soup restaurant that is quite popular. The side dishes (banchan) varied in quality; the little fish were good, but the potato and kimchi were a bit bland. Cucumber kimchi was good, and the soup was decent -- when I asked for extra spicy, they made the soup thicker with gochugaru (Korean pepper flakes) instead of just adding capsaicin. They are quite busy though so service was minimal. Bathroom was awful -- smelled gross, was somehow sticky and slippery at the same time (straight up wet).","Anthony, we're glad you enjoyed our tofu soup and fish banchan.

"If I could give this company 10 stars, I would! I am so glad I chose to go with Pro Masters to get the job done right!

This was especially hard for me because I bought this car brand new and had only owned it for 3 days shy of 1 year before the hail storm took place.

"We were greeted pretty promptly when we arrived for my birthday dinner, just my husband, myself and our son. We were given a booth on the Lindbergh side which was otherwise empty at the time, but a couple other tables were soon filled.  The decor in the main area seemed very Gulf coast/Margaritaville-esque which works!  The booth area we were in had had some folks go wild with a Sharpie, totally filled with drawings and writing, including requests for VenMo gifts, which was a bit weird. Our waitress was sweet, friendly and swift and brought us complimentary seafood bread which was tasty!  I ordered a half pound of king crab legs and a half pound boiled shrimp.  I chose the ""traditional"" boil and thought it was a little bland, but the crab was sweet and delicious with just some drawn butter and the cocktail sauce was perfectly horseradish-y for the shrimp.  My husband had Cajun seasoned boil with shrimp, crawfish and sausage.  It was huge and he really enjoyed it.  Our picky son had chicken nuggets that looked crispy and he actually did eat them, so fair enough. The bathrooms were clean, too.  Oh, and you should definitely make use of the bib and gloves provided with your seafood boil!  Only thing that would have been helpful would be some wet wipes, but hubby was able to clean up enough with napkins to visit the men's room for a full handwashing before we hit the road.","We're delighted to hear you had an enjoyable birthday dinner, Susan!

"Ordered delivery
1. Several missing food items in order with no communication and unable to reach store when I called
2. fried chicken is stale
3. candied yams tasted canned
4. mac and cheese lacking flavor
5. oxtail looks boiled and lacking flavor
6. cornbread and cornbread dressing is good
7. portion sizes are huge, only recommend this place if you plan on having this as leftovers (i.e. you are not traveling)

do not recommend ordering delivery as you need to confirm if food items are there.
Not happy and hope this can be resolved.","We sincerely apologize for your recent experience, Selima. Ensuring complete orders and meeting your food expectations is fundamental to us. We regret the missing items and communication lapse. It's disappointing to hear our fried chicken, candied yams, mac and cheese, and oxtail fell short. However, your positive feedback on our cornbread, dressing, and portion sizes is appreciated. Your input is crucial for our improvement. We hope for a chance to serve you better next time.","We sincerely apologize for your recent experience, Selima. Ensuring complete orders and meeting your food expectations is fundamental to us.
